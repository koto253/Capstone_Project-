# Predicting GDP per Capita Using Economic Indicators

## Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to develop regression models to predict GDP per Capita using various economic indicators. Data has been collected from over 190 countries, covering a period of 20 years. The analysis focuses on GDP per Capita (US$) as the dependent variable and several other features as independent variables. By leveraging this extensive historical data, we aim to generate insights that are both precise and actionable, enhancing our understanding of economic growth patterns and their driving factors.
